# Gameboy

A pretty basic gameboy emulator. Has its fair share of bugs but it's pretty functional for the basic cartridges (no memory banking) and does work for cartridges with banking. There's at least one cpu instruction (I believe) or something with timing that's not functioning which is causing a lot bugs.
